""" Problem 56: Powerful Digit Sum

https://projecteuler.net/problem=56

Goal: Considering natural numbers of the form :math:`a^b`, where a, b < N,
find the maximum digit sum.

Constraints: 5 <= N <= 200

Googol: A massive number that is 1 followed by 100 zeroes, i.e. :math:`10^100`.
Another unimaginably large number is :math:`100^100`, which is 1 followed by 200
zeroes. Despite both their sizes, the sum of each number's digits equals 1.

e.g.: N = 5
      :math:`4^4 = 256 \\to 2 + 5 + 6 = 13`
      max sum = 13
