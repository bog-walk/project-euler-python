# Project Euler __ Python
___
A Python solution set for problems corresponding to the
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) challenges.

Some problems have been altered to either generalise their goal or implement constraints, as
influenced by the problem outlines found on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges).
